# code-refactor-hw


## **Description**
I built this project because largely in order to test my skills and improve upon them the more I was able to use my resourcefulness the more I know I'd be ingrained into the workplace in my future. I
I feel as though I have learned a lot, through troubleshooting and more of the sort. I've had a few times where I felt like I was so lost and wanted to pull my hair out. especially with this below:

``.social-media-marketing-img-main {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 25px;
}
.digital-marketing-meeting-img-main {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 25px;
}
.online-reputation-management-img-main {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 25px; ``
  
  All in all I had a great time building this project and the knowledge acquired will certainly come to aid me in my future during projects.

## **Examples**
I definitely saw my growth navigating git bash and being able to largely put my skills to the test with shortcuts I had learned in a short amount of time being part of my course in coding Bootcamp. I feel the small things go a long way. the way you utilize shortcuts is probably the most vital thing I've learned.
